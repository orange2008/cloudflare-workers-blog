# A blog software hosted by Cloudflare Workers

**It uses Cloudflare Workers+Cloudflare KV.**

_Cloudflare KV provides 1 GB storage for free plan. It should enough for at least 10k articles._

_This project is forked from [This project](https://github.com/gdtool/cloudflare-workers-blog), I highly modified this project._

Different from original project:



```
Language: zh-CN -> en-US
Friendly constants edit experience
Pull all outside scripts,templates,stylesheets to this project.(All npm and WordPress packages will not be pulled due to copyright.)
```



I hope you enjoy it! See _tutorial.md_ to learn how to build it.
